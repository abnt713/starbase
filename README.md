Captain James T. Kirk said these words, followed by a short but rather deep
speech about accepting risk. A while later into the episode and BAM! Risk
actually happened, took form and could have gone pretty bad. But the funny
thing about risk is that it is a requirement for change. Without risk, Star Trek
would have been some kind of The Office in Space.

This repository contains a small endeavour about learning, trying and having a
constant worry about the future and how to maintain it. It takes some reckless
and unproven design decisions, but it is like that by design! Trying and fixing
stuff is the process to create not something perfect, but something to be proud
of - and I'm quite proud of this repository right here!
